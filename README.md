- 👋 Hi, I’m Sonu. Currently living in Espoo, Finland.I am a third year student in Bachelor of Automation Engineering.
- 👀 I’m strongly passionate about exploring both practical and theoritical aspects  of science.With a diverse range of interests,I am particularly drawn to the areas of IoT, robotics, and predictive maintenance for using AI. My academic focus extends to understanding complex topics such as mathematics(number thoery), quantum mechanics, and dimensions, where tI am motivated to independently explore and form hypotheses.
- 🌱 I’m having practical experience in automation engineering, with expertise in PLC programming, SolidWorks, EPLAN, and TwinCAT. In addition, I am  gaining hands-on knowledge in robotics using RobotStudio software and plan to build an AI agent to streamline job applications. While currently working in a research and development role in IT, I actively seeking internships that align more closely with my core interests.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with Automation Industries which promotes Energy.
